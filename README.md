By using Geant4, this code can simulate the Linear Energy Transfer (dE/dx) of silicon substrates when in contact with solar protons. A variety of substrate dimensions can be tested by changing the values 
specified in solidWorld. To better expand on this code, a variety of particle parameters can be included.
